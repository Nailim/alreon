Ok, ok, I can understand c being c, but I spent half a friggin hour trying to converter a bloddy string to an array of characters (whis a string basically is), so that the system() command would blurghle at me ><

All files done, trust you can run a bash script, converting all to appropriate mp3's
(these should be 16-bit, 48khz sample rate .wav's)
